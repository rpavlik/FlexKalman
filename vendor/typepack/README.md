# TypePack

TypePack is a small C++11 template metaprogramming library,
inspired by and based in part on Eric Niebler's "meta'
(maintained in the range-v3 library),
but written for limited purposes for OSVR-Core
and implemented to compile with MSVC 2013.

Like meta, it is licensed under the BSL-1.0.

It has been extracted from OSVR-Core and included here
since it is used by some utilities but is entirely
independent.

This separate version is maintained at https://github.com/rpavlik/TypePack
