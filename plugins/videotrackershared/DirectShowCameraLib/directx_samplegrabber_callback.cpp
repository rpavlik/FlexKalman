// This is the routine that processes each sample.  It gets the information
// about the sample (one frame) from the SampleGrabber, then marks itself as
// being ready to process the sample.  It then blocks until the sample has been
// processed by the associated camera server. The hand-off is handled by using
// two Windows system events, acting somewhat like semaphores, in
// MediaSampleExchange.
//
// The directx camera must be sure to free an open sample (if any) after
// changing the state of the filter graph, so that this doesn't block
// indefinitely.  This means that the destructor for any object using this
// callback object has to destroy this object.  The destructor sets _stayAlive
// to false to make sure this thread terminates.
//
// The discussion below relates more closely to an earlier implementation that
// used booleans as crude semaphore substitutes: it has been left for its
// instructive value.
// The first semaphore (imageReady) controls access to the callback handler's
// buffer so that the application thread will only read it when it is full. The
// second sempaphore (imageDone) controls when the handler routine can release a
// sample; it makes sure that the sample is not released before the application
// thread is done processing it.
