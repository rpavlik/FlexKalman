# Guidelines for Development/Contributing {#HACKING}

Please use `clang-format` to keep the code tidy. The `.clang-format` config file
is in the root of the repository. We're basically using the LLVM style, except
with 4-space indentation, inner namespace indentation, and auto C++ detection
(since turning on C++11 in `clang-format` sometimes makes things not work in
less-compelling compilers).

The `git clang-format` functionality, which runs `clang-format` only on staged
changes in a Git repo, is a good way to keep your changes clean while being
careful to not change other files because of some difference in clang version,
etc.

If you're using Windows, please install a recent [llvm/clang binary][llvmwin],
and choose to add the directory to the path. (Makes it easier.) If you've got a
non-Express version of Visual Studio, you might also want the clang-format
plugin. In either case, there are a pair of scripts in `/devtools/`:

- `format-project.sh` runs `clang-format` in place using unix `find` to
  hopefully grab every file. Windows users need Git for Windows installed and
  handling `.sh` files to run this. (A default install will do that, IIRC)

- `format-file.cmd` runs `clang-format` in place on whatever file or files you
  drop on it - useful if you want some other code to also look in the same
  style.

## Naming Conventions

### General

- Macros, constants, and enum values are all caps.

- The "body" of a type name is in CamelCase.

- Functions are camelCase except for the first character.

- No Hungarian notation - the closest we come is `m_whatever` for
  some private class members, though a trailing `_` is easier to read.

- Be consistent and match surrounding code.

### C++ Code

- Use lowercase namespaces such as `flexkalman`, nested appropriately as
  required.

- Do not add prefixes (`C`, `I`, `flexkalman`, `FlexKalman`, etc) to the
  beginning of types or functions - those are either Hungarian notation or made
  redundant by C++'s support for namespaces.
